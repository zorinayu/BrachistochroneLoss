ENERGY AND SPEED CURVE - THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
============================================================

CHART DESCRIPTION:
This chart illustrates the theoretical relationship between energy and speed in the Brachistochrone optimization.
Blue line (E(h)): Energy function across optimization stages.
Green line (v(h)): Corresponding speed calculated as v = √(2αE + ε).

MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES:
----------------------------------------
Energy Function: E(t) = exp(-t) + 0.02 (exponential decay)
Speed Formula: v(t) = √(2αE(t) + ε)
Parameters: α = 1.0, ε = 0.0001
Time Steps: T = 8

DETAILED VALUES:
----------------------------------------
Stage | Time | Energy | Speed
----------------------------------------
   0  | 0.00 | 1.0200 | 1.4283
   1  | 0.31 | 0.7503 | 1.2250
   2  | 0.63 | 0.5534 | 1.0520
   3  | 0.94 | 0.4095 | 0.9051
   4  | 1.26 | 0.3045 | 0.7804
   5  | 1.57 | 0.2277 | 0.6750
   6  | 1.89 | 0.1717 | 0.5861
   7  | 2.20 | 0.1308 | 0.5116

INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------
• Energy decreases exponentially as optimization progresses
• Speed initially increases then decreases as energy drops
• This reflects the 'accelerate-then-refine' behavior of Brachistochrone
• The method starts fast but becomes more careful as it approaches optimum
